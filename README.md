Our school's internship database had thousands of emails of different companies and the employees working there. 
Since it would have been very difficult to email each person on that list and study for exams, I made this Python script that requires:
  - a list of emails
  - a CV in pdf format
  - email
  - password
  - a default email template

and sends an email, with CV attached, to all the addresses in the list.

### How to run
Since, this was made in 2021 Google just required that you turn on 'Less Secure App Access' and it allowed access.
Now it requires [2-Step Verification](https://towardsdatascience.com/automate-sending-emails-with-gmail-in-python-449cc0c3c317) to do the same with a generated password.

Then just have the CV and list of addresses in the same folder and voila!
